On Day 2, I focused on building and refining an interactive Tableau dashboard using the Global Superstore dataset. My goal was to uncover actionable insights by visualizing sales and profit trends across various dimensions.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations Created:
Regional Sales Performance â€“ Identified top and underperforming regions.

Sales & Profit Over Time â€“ Analyzed monthly trends by product category.

Product Category Sales Breakdown â€“ Used a treemap for granular sub-category analysis.

Top 10 Products by Sales â€“ Highlighted highest revenue-generating products.

Segment-wise Sales & Profit Impact â€“ Compared customer segments' contributions.

ðŸ§  Key Insights:
Central region and Technology category lead in sales and profit.

Certain sub-categories generate high sales but poor profit.

Consumer segment dominates sales, but Corporate has higher profit margins.
